                <p class="title">Song: Tiger Rag</p>
                <p class="text">- During WWI, Dixieland jazz was on the rise</p>
                <p class="text">- Songs such as Tiger Rag by the Original Dixieland Jass Band were popular</p>
                <p class="text">- The original recording under Aeolian-Vocalion Records in 1917 did not sell well due to the fact that they were recorded in a vertical format which could not be played on most phonographs of that time</p>
                <p class="text">- In 1918, a new recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company phonographs were made and established the song as a jazz standard</p>
                <p class="text">- The song exploded in popularity during the late 1910s and 1920s, being recorded by hundreds of bands and appearing on soundtracks to movies and cartoons when energetic music was needed</p>
                <p class="text">- "Tiger Rag" had over 136 versions by 1942 being recorded by artists such as Art Tatum, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra (in a version with lyrics), Duke Ellington, Bix Beiderbecke, and Louis Armstrong</p>
                <p class="text">- Notable recordings of the song include the 1931 million-selling version by the Mills Brothers, a 1952 version by Les Paul and Mary Ford, and a 1954 bebop version by Charlie Parker</p>
                <p class="text">- During the early 1930s it became a standard showoff piece for big band arrangers and soloists</p>
                <p class="text">- The song declined in popularity during the Swing era in the late 1930s due to becoming too cliche</p>

                <p class="subtitle">WWI Music</p>
                <p class="text">- In the 1890s to the late 1910s, ragtime was one of the most dominant forms of music</p>
                <p class="text">- After WWI, jazz replaced ragtime as the dominant style of popular music</p>
                <p class="text">- WWI inspired various songs, causing ragtime to be replaced with war songs as the most prevalent form of popular music</p>
                <p class="text">- Their moods range from jubilant (“Over There”) to hesitant (“Don’t Send My Darling Boy Away”) to anti-German (“Bing! Bang! Bing ‘Em on the Rhine”)</p>
                <p class="text">- Other songs depict the everyday lives of soldiers, such as Irving Berlin’s “Oh How I Hate Getting Up In the Morning” and “I Don’t Want to Get Well,” a duet by Arthur Fields and Grace Woods</p>
                <p class="text">- Love is another common theme in songs such as “If He Can Fight Like He Can Love, Goodnight Germany,” where female performers sing to their sweethearts overseas</p>
                <p class="text">- Some songs give a voice to women’s wartime roles overseas such as in “Oh Frenchy,” a tune about an American nurse serving in Paris falling in love with her patient</p>
                <p class="text">War songs came from many points of view and reflected a unique mixture of sentiments</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Dance</p>
                <p class="text">- Before WWI, ragtime dances were popular on dance floors</p>
                <p class="text">- Popular dances within the ragtime movement include the Fox-Trot, the Tango, and the One-Step</p>
                <p class="text">- During WWI, as people left to fight in the war, dance floors were left deserted</p>
                <p class="text">- After WWI, ragtime was seen as old-fashioned, a relic from a distant and innocent pre-war past</p>
                <p class="text">- There was a resurgence of new dances in the Jazz Age such as the Charleston</p>

                <p class="text">- The song was featured in the American black Broadway musical comedy show Runnin' Wild in 1923 and 1924</p>
                <p class="text">- It is one of the first and most popular uses of the stride piano technique as well as the dotted quarter note - dotted quarter note - quarter note clave which is now iconic to the song</p>
                <p class="text">- The rhythm was inspired by dockworkers in the harbor city of Charleston, South Carolina</p>
                <p class="text">- It was accompanied by the Charleston dance</p>
                <p class="text">- The Charleston reached peak popularity in 1926 and 1927</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Roaring 20's Music</p>
                <p class="text">- The Roaring 20’s were defined by economic prosperity and the rise in popular jazz music</p>
                <p class="text">- Bands such as the Benny Goodman Big Band, Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, Duke Ellington and His Orchestra, and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings were extremely popular</p>
                <p class="text">- Racial integration during this time also improved, especially within these bands</p>

                <p class="title">Song: Over The Rainbow</p>
                <p class="text">- The song is a ballad composed by Harold Arlen with lyrics by Yip Harburg written for the movie “The Wizard of Oz” and was sung by actress Judy Garland</p>
                <p class="text">- It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became Garland's signature song</p>

                <p class="text">- Many jazz artists have created arrangements and recordings of the song including Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Keith Jarrett, Stanley Jordan, Glenn Miller, Bud Powell, Boyd Raeburn, and Art Tatum</p>
                <p class="text">- The melody of this song is painted above the chorus and band rooms at Hightstown High School</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Great Depression Music</p>
                <p class="text">- One highly influential figure in the jazz world during the Great Depression was Benny Goodman, a jazz clarinetist and bandleader known as the "King of Swing"</p>
                <p class="text">- His concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 16, 1938 is described by critic Bruce Eder as "the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music."</p>

                <p class="title">Song: White Christmas</p>
                <p class="text">- White Christmas is a song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting written by Irving Berlin in 1942</p>
                <p class="text">- The most famous version by Bing Crosby is the world’s best-selling single with over 50 million copies sold worldwide</p>
                <p class="text">- The combined total sales of all versions of the song is over 100 million copies</p>
                <p class="text">- When Berlin was staying up all night writing the song, he told his secretary, “Grab your pen and take down this song. I just wrote the best song I’ve ever written -- heck, I just wrote the best song that anybody’s ever written!”</p>
                <p class="text">- The song originally did not do well due to being overshadowed by Holiday Inn’s first hit song, “Be Careful, It’s My Heart”</p>
                <p class="text">- However, at the end of the 1942, it spend eleven weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, returning to the Number 1 spot in 1945 and 1946</p>
                <p class="text">- It returned to the annual pop chart twenty times</p>
                <p class="text">- The melancholy lyrics of the song such as “just like the ones I used to know,” combined with the comforting imagery of home in “where the treetops glisten,” resonated with listeners during WWII especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor, flooding the Armed Forces Network with requests for the song</p>
                <p class="text">- It’s one of the most memorable uses of the newly invented and refined microphone due to its intimate vocals and whistling by Bing Crosby</p>
                <p class="text">- The song is featured in the popular 1954 film “White Christmas,” the second highest grossing film of the year</p>
